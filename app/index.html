                            Every individual in our company, from the founders to the most recent member of our team, is
                            expected to become an industry-wide thought and practice leader in a discipline to the extent
                            they can teach others within and outside the company about the practice. At the same time,
                            the same individual is expected to work as a producing expert on analysis, designs, or development
                            in a consulting engagement, venture, or an open source initiative. Finally, the same individual
                            is expected to be learning something they are completely unfamiliar with, either by engaging
                            in a formal course or degree, or by seeking a mentor within or outside the company.

                            with people who stick to their principles despite the promise of immediate bounty.

                            disruptive, and discontinuous solutions, we are a distributed, disruptive, and discontinuous organization
                            by choice.

                        <h3>High-hanging fruit</h3>
                        <p>
                            Businesses today face unprecedented complexity in their markets and organisations. The majority of
                            businesses ignore this complexity by reducing it to quick wins with low-hanging fruit, which neither
                            differentiates them nor makes them competitive. We help exceptional and driven businesses identify,
                            create, and sustain &ldquo;high-hanging fruit&rdquo; that makes their market-facing solutions differentiating
                            and market-winning, while keeping their organisation highly reactive to change.

                            <p>Create systems that embrace existing forces, shed non-essential and historical complexity, and empower those with an entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
                            <p>We operate from a deep conviction that today&apos;s business landscape needs profound change. We apply Embodied Making, the leading agile design method to effect this change. We work with clients ranging from large corporates to start-ups, entrepreneurs, and independent consultants who share our values. We help transform demand-supply driven project structures into product organizations where it&apos;s everyone&apos;s job to create, sustain, and re-create products, and no one&apos;s job to solely monitor and supervise others.</p>

                            <p>Why can&apos;t business applications be fun-to-use and well-built like some of the best games are?</p>
                            <p>There are online games that give real-time interactive experiences to a few hundred thousand online users, and somehow CRM or ERP applications are still struggling to create or change order-data for a few thousand users for greater expense and poorer efficiency.</p>
                            <p>We feel business applications need to be built in better ways, and we&apos;re proud to be part of that change. We offer development services for creating web and mobile products by balancing the needs of the market with leading technology. We are industry-leaders in developing real-time and reactive applications, and we are proud to have industry thought-leaders as our clients.</p>

                        <h2>Work with us because</h2>
                        <h3>business applications can be a lot better</h3>
                        <p>
                            Far too many business applications do little more than get data out of a database and show it on a screen using a cocktail of frameworks. We
                            are inspired by smart systems and gaming technology to bring a unique experience to our business applications.
                        </p>
                        <h3>we learn from our mistakes and successes</h3>
                        <p>
                            We started Product Foundry because we wanted the space to explore what business software could be without restrictions. Innovation means we are going to make mistakes
                            We don't want investment nannies on our coat-tails telling us what we can and can not do do. Rather, we try things out and work with the conviction that the only
                            people we answer to are our peers. We are self-financed and proud of it. We don’t make decisions based on fear and keep an open mind to improve our work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>doing is harder than talking</h3>
                        <p>
                            There is too much social noise around technology. We want to work with people who get things working, rather talking or about it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>job titles don;t matter</h3>
                        <p>
                            We don’t have self-promoting titles. In Product Foundry, it is no one’s job to watch others work. Trust is our operating principle, and we believe nothing generates trust
                            like transparency, visibility and results.
                        </p>
                        <h3>compensation is fair and transparent</h3>
                        <p>
                            We don’t want to work somewhere where people worry about their income. Everyone is compensated fairly and benefits from product revenue.
                            Every year we take our income, decide what to reinvest in the business, and share the remainder in an open structure with our team members.
                        </p>
                        <h3>we are a team</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe everyone should care about all aspects of delivering a high quality product. Engineers care about user experience and marketing, marketeers about technology.
                            We provide business consulting services with the same fervour that we build our software.
                        </p>
                        <h3>work is a place to enjoy</h3>
                        <p>
                            We learn early in our career that work is a place where you come to pretend. Pretend to be interested in things you are not or pretend to be someone you are not.
                            Our work is something that occupies a big portion of our lives, so we respect everyone to be themselves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>we provide top-of-the-bill consulting</h3>
                        <p>
                            We have a distinct culture of our own, but we can’t exist in a vacuum. We love our corporate customers and learn with individuals that work with us within them.
                            We regularly get hired to help make their development, design and management teams better by working as an integral part of their organization.
                        </p>
                        <h3>we love entrepreneurship</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being an independent engineer feels great and provides a solid income, but mostly involves consulting work. Realizing a product is hard. How do you assemble the
                            right team without spending all your savings? What about legal? sales? marketing? We work with talent on all aspects of our own products, while offering a decent income.
                            We have a formalized reward structure in which we share product revenue based on contribution, offering an alternative to complete independence.
                        </p>

                    <div id="netherlands2" class="hidden job-listing">
                        <h2>marketing specialist <small>amsterdam, the netherlands</small></h2>
                        <h3>technology leadership</h3>
                        <p>
                            We are searching for a content-oriented, strategy-focused and market-driven Marketing Lead to develop and operate a Purple-Ocean Product Offering.
                        </p>
                        <h3>attitude over experience</h3>
                        <p>
                            We expect a lot from each other in Product Foundry, and we prefer hiring for attitude over experience. With the right attitude and lack of experience,
                            we believe people can continuously learn new things and become more skilled. With the right experience but a limited learning attitude, we believe
                            people limit themselves to a narrow band of abilities. We're proud of our track record of giving individuals both the space and the constraints
                            to grow so that they can demonstrably become skilled in their area of practice.
                        </p>
                        <h3>passionate and curious</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe we need to change how we think about business applications. Very few people enjoy using them and most of them help limit business growth
                            rather than help it flourish. We expect our Marketing Lead to have strong empathy with people and the situations they face.
                        </p>
                        <h3>excellent written and spoken communications</h3>
                        <p>
                            As the global language of business, we expect our Marketing Lead to be able to express themselves in both written and spoken English.
                        </p>
                        <h3>working independently with a strong team</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe in practices that help empower each other. Sharing knowledge in a team is a good way of making sure that each member of the team is able to operate
                            independently of each other when required. As we get new insights, contributing to common knowledge helps in growing and scaling that knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <h3>content focussed</h3>
                        <p>
                            We believe that people who think clearly also write and speak clearly. The best marketing campaigns are independent of trends and fads, and have a timeless quality.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="netherlands1" class="hidden job-listing">
                        <h2>front-end ninja <small>amsterdam, the netherlands</small></h2>
                        <h3>self-motivated, learner, communicator</h3>
                        <p>
                            We work with people that are interested in working on the next challenge. We are global and distributed by choice which requires excellent written and spoken
                            communication skills. You consider yourself a senior developer and are comfortable with what you can contribute. You have a demonstrable track-record of passionately
                            creating beautiful software and you prefer working with peers although you have led development teams.
                        </p>
                        <h3>proficiency in multiple languages</h3>
                        <p>
                            We prefer individuals who have demonstrable knowledge in Scala, Java and Javascript, which we happen to use most, but are also open to individuals with
                            demonstrable track records in other languages like Python, Ruby, C#, F# and Clojure.
                        </p>
                        <h3>demonstrable track-record, preferably on open source projects</h3>
                        <p>
                            We prefer individuals with an established track record in making business applications, and we prefer discussing technology and reviewing your code over your CV.
                            If you regularly write about technology, send us a link to your website or publications.
                        </p>
                        <h3>dogma-free, results-driven</h3>
                        <p>
                            We enjoy working with people who question things to achieve results and apply processes only when they make sense.
                        </p>
                        <h3>engineers over technicians</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one. You are willing to try out things no one has before and you are able to look beyond the
                            “awe of implementation” to determine how to minimize complexity in the systems you develop. You’re not interested in copy-pasting code snippets,
                            but working out why and how things should work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>front-end/back-end? excellence does not divide</h3>
                        <p>
                            We prefer working with Engineers who don’t distinguish between the back-end or front-end of things, and are able to get things working on both ends. Still, for this
                            position we are looking for someone fluent in Javascript (ES6) and AngularJS. Phaser experience is a pre. We want to deliver a kick-ass experience for our new
                            collaboration software and this is where we need you most.
                        </p>
                        <h3>solid understanding of web technology</h3>
                        <p>
                            We look for very strong and demonstrable knowledge of web security and protocols.
