                            Every individual in our company, from the founders to the most recent member of our team, is
                            expected to become an industry-wide thought and practice leader in a discipline to the extent
                            they can teach others within and outside the company about the practice. At the same time,
                            the same individual is expected to work as a producing expert on analysis, designs, or development
                            in a consulting engagement, venture, or an open source initiative. Finally, the same individual
                            is expected to be learning something they are completely unfamiliar with, either by engaging
                            in a formal course or degree, or by seeking a mentor within or outside the company.

                            It&apos;s often tempting to chase a fleeting opportunity and compromise our culture. We don&apos;t like

                            with people who stick to their principles despite the promise of immediate bounty.

                            disruptive, and discontinuous solutions, we are a distributed, disruptive, and discontinuous organization
                            by choice.

                        <h3>High-hanging fruit</h3>
                        <p>
                            Businesses today face unprecedented complexity in their markets and organisations. The majority of
                            businesses ignore this complexity by reducing it to quick wins with low-hanging fruit, which neither
                            differentiates them nor makes them competitive. We help exceptional and driven businesses identify,
                            create, and sustain &ldquo;high-hanging fruit&rdquo; that makes their market-facing solutions differentiating
                            and market-winning, while keeping their organisation highly reactive to change.

                    <p>We operate from a deep conviction that today&apos;s business landscape needs profound change, and we structure
                        all of our work in terms of people, planet and profit. The method we apply to effect profound change is
                        called embodied making, the leading agile design method. We work with clients (both corporates and
                        start-ups), entrepreneurs, and independent consultants who share these values. For our clients, we help
                        them move away from demand-supply projects to creating product organizations where it&apos;s everyone&apos;s job
                        to create, sustain, and re-create products, and no one&apos;s job to solely monitor and supervise others.
                        In our social ventures, we work to create systems that embrace existing forces, shed non-essential and
                        historical complexity, and empower those with an entrepreneurial spirit. And in our open source
                        initiatives, we work to create the foundations of a real-time business.

                                    to <a href="http://youtu.be/vrKFu9D6h2o" target="_blank">Dabbawallahs in Mumbai</a>,
                                    we see emerging practices in pockets around the world that can help shape business
                                    practices globally.

                                <p>
                                    Understanding these practices requires deep enquiry, contemplation, recording,
                                    analysis, design, and application, and we feel that the form of pattern languages
                                    are the most suitable for structuring these practices.
                                </p>
