                            Every individual in our company, from the founders to the most recent member of our team, is
                            expected to become an industry-wide thought and practice leader in a discipline to the extent
                            they can teach others within and outside the company about the practice. At the same time,
                            the same individual is expected to work as a producing expert on analysis, designs, or development
                            in a consulting engagement, venture, or an open source initiative. Finally, the same individual
                            is expected to be learning something they are completely unfamiliar with, either by engaging
                            in a formal course or degree, or by seeking a mentor within or outside the company.

                            with people who stick to their principles despite the promise of immediate bounty.

                        <h3>High-hanging fruit</h3>
                        <p>
                            Businesses today face unprecedented complexity in their markets and organisations. The majority of
                            businesses ignore this complexity by reducing it to quick wins with low-hanging fruit, which neither
                            differentiates them nor makes them competitive. We help exceptional and driven businesses identify,
                            create, and sustain &ldquo;high-hanging fruit&rdquo; that makes their market-facing solutions differentiating
                            and market-winning, while keeping their organisation highly reactive to change.

                            <p>We operate from a deep conviction that today&apos;s business landscape needs profound change. We apply Embodied Making, the leading agile design method to effect this change. We work with clients ranging from large corporates to start-ups, entrepreneurs, and independent consultants who share our values. We help transform demand-supply driven project structures into product organizations where it&apos;s everyone&apos;s job to create, sustain, and re-create products, and no one&apos;s job to solely monitor and supervise others.</p>

                            <p>There are online games that give real-time interactive experiences to a few hundred thousand online users, and somehow CRM or ERP applications are still struggling to create or change order-data for a few thousand users for greater expense and poorer efficiency.</p>
                            <p>We feel business applications need to be built in better ways, and we&apos;re proud to be part of that change. We offer development services for creating web and mobile products by balancing the needs of the market with leading technology. We are industry-leaders in developing real-time and reactive applications, and we are proud to have industry thought-leaders as our clients.</p>

                    <div id="jobs-intro">
                        <h3>because business applications can be a lot better</h3>
                        <p>Far too many business applications do little more than get data out of a database and show it on a screen using a cocktail of frameworks. We’re inspired by games like Need for Speed and Starcraft, and we want to bring game quality technology and design to business applications. It took us a while to figure out how to make such applications, and we have a method and a platform to create awesome business applications.</p>
                        <h3>because we want the space to make and learn from our own mistakes</h3>
                        <p>We started Product Foundry because we wanted the space to explore what business software could be without restrictions, and this meant we would need to make mistakes. We didn’t want an investment nanny on our coat-tails telling us what we could and couldn’t do and how to make something that fit nicely into some hype cycle. Rather, we wanted to try something out and work on it with the conviction that the only people we answered to were our peers. We’re self-financed and proud of it. And along the way, we found that some businesses valued this attitude and started hiring us to build software for them by giving us the same space. We don’t make decisions based on fear. We don’t defend our work out of fear of losing face.</p>
                        <h3>because it’s easier to talk about technology than to get things working</h3>
                        <p>There’s too much social noise around technology. And there are far too many people in it that know little or nothing about it that do little more than generate hot air. We want to work with people who would rather get things working than talking about it.</p>
                        <h3>because it’s too easy giving each other glorious titles</h3>
                        <p>We don’t have self-promoting titles like CEO, CTO, CFO and as many Vice Presidents as there is space. In Product Foundry, it’s no one’s job to watch others work. This means trust is our operating principle, and nothing generates trust like transparency, visibility and results.</p>
                        <h3>because fair compensation in every way does matter</h3>
                        <p>We don’t want to work somewhere where a bunch of people drive big swanky cars and others come to work in dinky ones. We are transparent about our salaries, and everyone in the company (including the founders) earns a salary slightly higher with comparable market salaries. Every year we take our income, decide what to reinvest in the business, and then share the remainder in an open structure with our team members.</p>
                        <h3>because marketing is far too important to leave to only marketeers</h3>
                        <p>We believe marketing should form the fabric of a company that everyone in the company understands and applies. And we believe it’s easier to teach engineers about art than teaching artists about engineering. Or marketing and business for that matter. We provide business consulting services with the same fervour that we build our software.</p>
                        <h3>because work isn’t somewhere we come to pretend</h3>
                        <p>We learn early in our career that work is a place where you come to pretend. Pretend to be interested in things you aren’t. Pretend to be someone you are not. Pretending to like people you don’t. Pretend that things that matter most to you don’t because it’s not part of the status quo. Our work is something that occupies a big portion of our lives, and it’s somewhere we don’t want to pretend.</p>
                        <h3>and just because we want things to be different doesn’t make them so</h3>
                        <p>We have a distinct culture of our own, but we don’t and can’t exist in a vaccum. We have corporate customers, and we rely on them for most of our revenue. Corporates are what they are, and even the nicest ones have a lot of complexity. What makes our engagements with corporates rewarding are the individuals that work with us within them. We regularly get hired to help make their development, design and management teams better by working as an integral part of their organization. We define exit criteria when we start, and we don’t mind upsetting people to reconfigure how an organization should work.</p>

                        <h3>technology leadership</h3>
                        <p>This position is for the most senior position in our Cluj-Napoca office. The individual who will assume this role will have leadership and profit-sharing responsibility and be expected to build and sustain product engineering team.</p>
                        <h3>self-motivated work ethic, lifelong learning attitude, skilled communicator</h3>
                        <p>We want to work with people that are more interested in working on the next challenge than discussing the success of their last one. We’re global and distributed by choice which requires excellent written and spoken communication skills. You consider yourself, and are considered by others in technology conferences and open source projects, to be a senior developer. You have a demonstrable track-record of passionately creating beautiful software, and you prefer working with peers although you have led development teams.</p>
                        <h3>proficiency in multiple languages</h3>
                        <p>We would prefer individuals who have demonstrable knowledge in Scala, Java and Javascript, but are also open to individuals with demonstrable track records in other languages like Python, Ruby, C#, F# and Clojure.</p>
                        <h3>demonstrable track-record, preferably on open source projects</h3>
                        <p>We would prefer reviewing your code over your CV. As this is not possible for any commercial work you may have done, we would prefer to see your commits on an open source project. Ideally, please provide us with your git account. If you regularly write about technology, send us a link to your website or publications.</p>
                        <h3>dogma-free, results-driven</h3>
                        <p>Rituals like sprints and stand-up meetings only make sense when there’s worthwhile content to within them. We like working with people who question things to get things done and don’t go through rituals because "sure they failed, but at least they followed the process".</p>
                        <h3>front-end/back-end? excellence doesn’t divide</h3>
                        <p>We prefer working with Engineers who don’t distinguish between the back-end or front-end of things, and are able to get things working on both ends.</p>
                        <h3>engineers over technicians</h3>
                        <p>It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one. You’re willing to try out things no one has before and you are able to look beyond the “awe of implementation” to determine how to minimize complexity in the systems you develop. You’re not interested in copy-pasting code snippets, but working out why and how things should work.</p>
                        <h3>solid understanding of web technology</h3>
                        <p>You should have very strong and demonstrable knowledge of web security and protocols.</p>
                        <h3>we prefer working with freelancers and giving them a real alternative</h3>
                        <p>Freelancing is fun and pays well as long as you keep making the hours and have decent clients. We desire the same kind of entrepreneurship from everyone in our organization. We offer the network, collaboration and financial support to make something awesome, without ever resorting to an employer - employee relationship. We prefer hiring the best freelancers in the market and giving them a stable, sustainable and comparable income from premium consulting rates and product licensing revenue.</p>
