# Getting started

## Tool installation

### OSX

#### Homebrew package manager

First, install Homebrew.

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

Then, ````brew update```` to ensure your Homebrew is up to date.

```bash
brew update
```

As a safe measure, run ````brew doctor```` to make sure your system is ready to brew. Follow any recommendations from brew doctor.

```bash
brew doctor
```

Next, add the Homebrew location to your ````$PATH````

Create or edit ````~/.bash_profile````

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, source your profile file after adding/saving

```bash
. ~/.bash_profile
```

#### ImageMagick

ImageMagick is required for transforming images during the build

```bash
brew install imagemagick
convert
```

#### NPM Node.js package manager

Install Node (npm will be installed with node)

```bash
brew install node
```

#### Ruby and Compass

Ruby should be available, make sure it is installed

```bash
ruby -version
```

Next, install Compass

```bash
sudo gem install compass
```

### All platforms

#### Yeoman

Install Yeoman, this should also install Grunt and Bower but it doesn't so let's be explicit.

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
```

Install some generators.

```bash
npm install -g generator-webapp
npm install -g generator-backbone
```

#### Getting the code

With proper SSH setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Coena/product-foundry-site.git
```

Less optimal, will ask for GitHub username/password

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coena/product-foundry-site.git
```

Next, cd to the newly checked out folder

```bash
cd product-foundry-site
```

#### Download all dependencies

Every time a new dependency is added, use ````npm install```` and ````bower install```` to install modules and download dependencies into````app/bower_components````

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

## Running the application

Use Grunt to run the application.

```bash
grunt serve
```

The application starts on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## Running tests and making a release

The easiest way to run all tests and make a build is by using the default Grunt task.

```bash
grunt
```

The release is build into a newly created ````dist```` folder

## Deploying to production

Deployment is done to our VVDK server. The password for the ````product-foundry.com```` user is required.

```bash
./deploy
```

### IDE

#### IntelliJ IDEA 13 / WebStorm

* Use File â†’ Import Project
* Select cloned project folder
* Import project from existing sources
